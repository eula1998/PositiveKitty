## Project description
People can get frustrated while working, and that results in negative language usage in the workspace. We want to make the work environment a bit more positive by reminding people to use a more neutral and positive tone when addressing negative comments

## System Architecture
Updating sentiment value:
Slack hook per message ‚Üí AWS API gateway ‚Üí AWS lambda ‚Üí AWS Comprehend ‚Üí AWS Dynamo saving sentiment score per user in the workspace ‚Üí response with sentiment value ‚Üí slack query giphy cat ‚Üí slack bot send cat gif to user

## Limitations
AWS Comprehend API requires a language code input. We might be able to detect the input language using Google Cloud language detection API. We will likely support english only for now.
